            <p class="first-paragraph">
                <strong>Infants and Toddlers </strong> Our infants and toddler rooms are guided by ‘continuous provision’ and the philosophy of RIE (Magda Gerber).   The educational program is based on  current early childhood research and is influenced by a UK approach called ‘continuous provision’  and active participatory learning based on the HighScope curriculum.  Continuous provision allows children to explore recent learning, practice new skills, and  follow their own interests. Educators are able to enhance the continuously offered experiences and intentional teaching in a context where they are sure that children have plenty of opportunities to practice and improve skills, knowledge and confidence in active, independent learning.   During active learning, educators encourage toddlers to discover the world around them by exploring and playing. The learning and development is anchored by long-term, trusting relationships with educators , who support children as they play.

            <div class="card card-body">
            <p>  The RIE approach to  care giving places the child at the centre of all actions and educators are responsive to children's needs . During care activities (changing , feeding, bathing, dressing, etc.),  educators create opportunities for interaction, cooperation,  respectful relationships and mutual enjoyment .  Educators create a  safe , challenging, predictable environment.  The educators role is to create an environment in which the child can best do all the things that the child would do naturally. The more predictable an environment is, the easier it is for infants to learn.  Educators give infants  plenty of time for uninterrupted play, exploration and discovery. </p>

            </div>

            <p>
                <strong>Kinder and Preschool</strong> Based on current thinking in early childhood education the Educational program is based on the Reggio Emilia Provocations approach, guided by HighScope Developmental Indicators and the Early Years Learning Framework.  Educators provide provocations that are deliberate and thoughtful decisions made to extend the ideas of children and recognise spontaneous teachable moments as they occur. The learning and development is anchored by trusting relationships with educators, who support children's they play.  Children have plenty of opportunities to practice and improve skills, knowledge and confidence in active, inquiry based learning.  During active learning, educators encourage children to discover the world around them by exploring and playing in indoor and outdoor spaces that are carefully planned, where every material is considered for its purpose, is ever evolving and encourages collaboration, communication and exploration.

              <p> Play-based experiences are set up in response to children's interests, developmental needs  and provide hands-on opportunities for children to explore, practice, stimulate thinking, test theories and take control of their own learning.

The image of the child as being confident and capable is reflected in our practices and spaces that meet children’s need for challenging play, with managed and controlled risk-taking part of everyday practice.
